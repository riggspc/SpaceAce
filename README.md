A project created by [riggspc](https://github.com/riggspc), [brianbeech775](https://github.com/brianbeech775), [polpolion](https://github.com/polpolion), and [tcharlton99](https://github.com/tcharlton99) for University of Michigan EECS 481.

This is a game designed for Grace, a young woman with cerebral palsy. Players can play this game with a joystick, WASD or directional key input (or a combination, for 2 player games). 

The game will eventually be released on the Windows App Store, or you can download the source and Visual Studio project files and compile yourself to play!
