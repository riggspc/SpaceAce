Space Ace
=========

A project created by @riggspc, @brianbeech775, @polpolion, and @tcharlton99 for University of Michigan EECS 481.

This is a game designed for Grace, a young woman with cerebral palsy. Players can play this game with a joystick, WASD or directional key input (or a combination, for 2 player games). 

The game will eventually be released on the Windows App Store, or you can download the source and Visual Studio project files and compile yourself to play!
